## Information  
### Prefix  
The bot has no own prefix since all the commands are slash commands.  

### Why only slash commands
Personally, I don't like the idea that bots only have slash commands, but it seems Discord does. In 2022, we as developers will no longer be able to access message content. In order to use commands despite this change, we must now switch to slash commands. It wouldn't be very smart to create a bot now that will stop working in a couple of months ... That's why. I hope you understand and who knows, maybe one day we will like it!  

### Extra  
If you chose a really small amount of time, it can still take up to 3 minutes to work!
